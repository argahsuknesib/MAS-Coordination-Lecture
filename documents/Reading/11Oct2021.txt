The agent architecture uses three user defined selection functions.
The three selection functions are : 

Event ; 
This chooses one particular event from the event queue to be processed at each
reasoning cycle. It mainly implements the FIFO policy.

Means ;
The means selection function chooses one particular plan to be executed when multiple
different plans are available. 

Intention ;
Intention selection function chooses one particular intention among the different 
available ones in the set of functions that are available. Intentions may become
suspended for various reasons. 

Agent Reasoning Cycle (High Level Description) -->
The reasoning process can be divided into four main steps.

1. Retriving the part of the agent architecture that is interfacing 
with the shared environment the current set of available percepts.

Percepts directly impact the agent's beliefs whereas messages can affect
both the set of beliefs or goals are represented as events placed in an
event queue.

2. In the part of reasoning, the event selection function is used to select
one single event. With some relevant plans, we check the context of each plan
against the current set of the belief base to determine the set of applicable
plans.

3. Means selection function is called with some set of applicable plans.
4. Intention selection function selects one particular intention, and the next
required action of that intention is selected for execution in that reasoning
cycle. 


<-- The Environments Dimension -->

Environment is used as a programming abstraction to model resources and tools that
an agent can create, share and be able to do their jobs. 

Objective of their work is often represented by some artifact that we incrementaly build,
possibly cooperatively. It is possible to encapsulate things that are not properly modeled
as cognitive agents which are neitger autonomous or goal oriented. Examples are a Blackboard
or a Knowledge Base.

An environment is modeled as a workspace that agents can join to share and work with artifacts.
The term artifact has been taken activity theory and distributed cognition. Artifact abstraction
is introduced as a unit to structure and organize the environments. Artifacts are the basic
building blocks. Artifacts are basic entities to organize the nonautonomous and function
oriented part of it.

A&A also introduces workspace abstraction in order to structure and organize the overall
set of artifacts and agents. Workspace is a logical container of artifacts and agents.

A complex MAS is organized as a set of workspaces, distributed among multiple nodes of the network,
with agents possibly joining multiple workspaces at the same time.
